/* This file is an amalgamation of many separate C source files from PH7 version 2.1.

/*
 * ------------------------------
 * Compile time directives
 * ------------------------------
 * For most purposes, PH7 can be built just fine using the default compilation options.
 * However, if required, the compile-time options documented below can be used to omit
 * PH7 features (resulting in a smaller compiled library size) or to change the default
 * values of some parameters. 
 * Every effort has been made to ensure that the various combinations of compilation 
 * options work harmoniously and produce a working library.
 *
 * PH7_ENABLE_THREADS
 *   This option controls whether or not code is included in PH7 to enable it to operate
 *   safely in a multithreaded environment. The default is not. That is,all mutexing code
 *   is omitted and it is unsafe to use PH7 in a multithreaded program. When compiled
 *   with the PH7_ENABLE_THREADS directive enabled, PH7 can be used in a multithreaded
 *   program and it's safe to share the same virtual machine and engine instance between
 *   two or more threads.
 *   The value of PH7_ENABLE_THREADS can be determined at run-time using the
 *   ph7_lib_is_threadsafe() interface.When PH7 has been compiled with PH7_ENABLE_THREAD
 *   then the threading mode can be altered at run-time using the ph7_lib_config()
 *   interface together with one of these verbs:
 *      PH7_LIB_CONFIG_THREAD_LEVEL_SINGLE
 *      PH7_LIB_CONFIG_THREAD_LEVEL_MULTI
 *   Also note,platforms others than Windows and UNIX systems must install their own
 *   mutex subsystem via  ph7_lib_config() with a configuration verb set to
 *   PH7_LIB_CONFIG_USER_MUTEX. Otherwise the library is not threadsafe.
 *   Note that you must link PH7 with the POSIX threads library under UNIX-like systems
 *   (i.e: -lpthread).Otherwise you will get a link time error.
 * Options To Omit/Enable Features:
 *   The following options can be used to reduce the size of the compiled library
 *   by omitting optional features. This is probably only useful in embedded systems
 *   where space is especially tight, as even with all features included the PH7 library
 *   is relatively small. Don't forget to tell your compiler to optimize for binary
 *   size! (the -Os option if using GCC).
 *   Telling your compiler to optimize for size usually has a much larger impact
 *   on library footprint than employing any of these compile-time options.
 *   PH7_DISABLE_BUILTIN_FUNC
 *     PH7 come with more than 460 built-in functions suitable for most purposes ranging
 *     from string/XML/INI processing to ZIP extracting, Base64 encoding/decoding and so on.
 *     If this directive is enabled, all the built-in functions are omitted from the build.
 *     Note that language construct functions such as is_int(), is_string(), func_get_arg(),
 *     define(), etc. are not omitted from the build and are not affected by this directive.
 *   PH7_ENABLE_MATH_FUNC
 *     If this directive is enabled, built-in math functions such as sqrt(),abs(),
 *     log(), ceil(), etc. are included in the build. Note that you may need to link
 *     PH7 with the math library in same linux/BSD flavor (i.e: -lm).Otherwise you
 *     will get a link time error.
 *  PH7_DISABLE_DISK_IO
 *     If this directive is enabled, built-in Virtual File System functions such as
 *     chdir(), mkdir(), chroot(), unlink(), delete(), etc. are omitted from the build.
 *  PH7_DISABLE_HASH_IO
 *     If this directive is enabled, built-in hash functions such as md5(), sha1(),
 *     md5_file(), crc32(), etc. are omitted from the build.
 *  PH7_OMIT_FLOATING_POINT
 *     This option is used to omit floating-point number support from the PH7 library
 *     if compiling for a processor that lacks floating point support. When specified
 *     the library will substitute 64-bit integer arithmetic for floating-point which
 *     mean that 25.e-3 and 25 are equals and are of type integer.

 * value indicates failure.
 * Notes:
 * The default configuration is recommended for most applications and so the call to
 * [ph7_lib_config()] is usually not necessary. It is provided to support rare 
 * applications with unusual needs. 
 * The [ph7_lib_config()] interface is not threadsafe. The application must insure that
 * no other [ph7_*()] interfaces are invoked by other threads while [ph7_lib_config()]
 * is running. Furthermore, [ph7_lib_config()] may only be invoked prior to library
 * initialization using [ph7_lib_init()] or [ph7_init()] or after shutdown
 * by [ph7_lib_shutdown()]. If [ph7_lib_config()] is called after [ph7_lib_init()]
 * or [ph7_init()] and before [ph7_lib_shutdown()] then it will return PH7_LOCKED.
 * Refer to the official documentation for more information on the configuration verbs
 * and their expected parameters.

 * Note that Windows and UNIX (Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, Mac OS X, etc.) users does not have to
 * worry about registering and installing a vfs since PH7 come with a built-in vfs for these

 * Host-application running on exotic systems (ie: Other than Windows and UNIX systems) must
 * register their own vfs in order to be able to use and call PHP system function.
 * Also note that the ph7_compile_file() interface depend on the xMmap() method of the underlying
 * vfs which mean that this method must be available (Always the case using the built-in VFS)
 * in order to use this interface.

/*
 * PH7 IO Stream Device.
 *
 * An instance of the ph7_io_stream object defines the interface between the PH7 core
 * and the underlying stream device.
 * A stream is a smart mechanism for generalizing file, network, data compression
 * and other IO operations which share a common set of functions using an abstracted
 * unified interface.
 * A stream device is additional code which tells the stream how to handle specific
 * protocols/encodings. For example, the http device knows how to translate a URL
 * into an HTTP/1.1 request for a file on a remote server.
 * PH7 come with two built-in IO streams device:
 * The file:// stream which perform very efficient disk IO and the php:// stream
 * which is a special stream that allow access various I/O streams (See the PHP official
 * documentation for more information on this stream).
 * A stream is referenced as: scheme://target 
 * scheme(string) - The name of the wrapper to be used. Examples include: file,http,https,ftp,
 * ftps, compress.zlib, compress.bz2, and php. If no wrapper is specified,the function default
 * is used (typically file://). 
 * target - Depends on the device used. For filesystem related streams this is typically a path
 * and filename of the desired file.For network related streams this is typically a hostname,often
 * with a path appended. 
 * IO stream devices are registered using a call to ph7_vm_config() with a configuration verb
 * set to PH7_VM_CONFIG_IO_STREAM.
 * Currently the PH7 development team is working on the implementation of the http:// and ftp://
 * IO stream protocols. These devices will be available in the next major release of the PH7 engine.
 * Developers wishing to implement their own IO stream devices must understand and follow
 * The PH7 IO Stream C/C++ specification manual (http://ph7.symisc.net/io_stream_spec.html).

/*
 * The code in this file implements execution method of the PH7 Virtual Machine.
 * The PH7 compiler (implemented in 'compiler.c' and 'parse.c') generates a bytecode program
 * which is then executed by the virtual machine implemented here to do the work of the PHP
 * statements.
 * PH7 bytecode programs are similar in form to assembly language. The program consists
 * of a linear sequence of operations .Each operation has an opcode and 3 operands.
 * Operands P1 and P2 are integers where the first is signed while the second is unsigned.
 * Operand P3 is an arbitrary pointer specific to each instruction. The P2 operand is usually
 * the jump destination used by the OP_JMP,OP_JZ,OP_JNZ,... instructions.
 * Opcodes will typically ignore one or more operands. Many opcodes ignore all three operands.
 * Computation results are stored on a stack. Each entry on the stack is of type ph7_value.
 * PH7 uses the ph7_value object to represent all values that can be stored in a PHP variable.
 * Since PHP uses dynamic typing for the values it stores. Values stored in ph7_value objects
 * can be integers,floating point values,strings,arrays,class instances (object in the PHP jargon)
 * and so on.
 * Internally,the PH7 virtual machine manipulates nearly all PHP values as ph7_values structures.
 * Each ph7_value may cache multiple representations(string,integer etc.) of the same value.
 * An implicit conversion from one type to the other occurs as necessary.
 * Most of the code in this file is taken up by the [VmByteCodeExec()] function which does
 * the work of interpreting a PH7 bytecode program. But other routines are also provided
 * to help in building up a program instruction by instruction. Also note that sepcial
 * functions that need access to the underlying virtual machine details such as [die()],
 * [func_get_args()],[call_user_func()],[ob_start()] and many more are implemented here.

 * value set_error_handler(callable $error_handler)
 *  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 *   THIS FUNCTION IS DISABLED IN THE CURRENT RELEASE OF THE PH7 ENGINE.
 *  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 *  Sets a user-defined error handler function.
 *  This function can be used for defining your own way of handling errors during
 *  runtime, for example in applications in which you need to do cleanup of data/files
 *  when a critical error happens, or when you need to trigger an error under certain 
 *  conditions (using trigger_error()). 
 * Parameters
 *  $error_handler
 *   The user function needs to accept two parameters: the error code, and a string
 *   describing the error.
 *   Then there are three optional parameters that may be supplied: the filename in which
 *   the error occurred, the line number in which the error occurred, and the context in which
 *   the error occurred (an array that points to the active symbol table at the point the error occurred).
 *   The function can be shown as:
 *    handler ( int $errno , string $errstr [, string $errfile])
 *     errno
 *       The first parameter, errno, contains the level of the error raised, as an integer. 
 *   errstr
 *      The second parameter, errstr, contains the error message, as a string. 
 *   errfile
 *      The third parameter is optional, errfile, which contains the filename that the error
 *     was raised in, as a string. 
 *  Note:
 *   NULL may be passed instead, to reset this handler to its default state. 
 * Return
 *  Returns the name of the previously defined error handler, or NULL on error.
 *  If no previous handler was defined, NULL is also returned. If NULL is passed
 *  resetting the handler to its default state, TRUE is returned.

 * int extract(array &$var_array[,int $extract_type = EXTR_OVERWRITE[,string $prefix = NULL ]])
 *   Import variables into the current symbol table from an array.
 * Parameters
 * $var_array
 *  An associative array. This function treats keys as variable names and values
 *  as variable values. For each key/value pair it will create a variable in the current symbol
 *  table, subject to extract_type and prefix parameters.
 *  You must use an associative array; a numerically indexed array will not produce results
 *  unless you use EXTR_PREFIX_ALL or EXTR_PREFIX_INVALID.
 * $extract_type
 *  The way invalid/numeric keys and collisions are treated is determined by the extract_type.
 *  It can be one of the following values:
 *   EXTR_OVERWRITE
 *       If there is a collision, overwrite the existing variable. 
 *   EXTR_SKIP
 *       If there is a collision, don't overwrite the existing variable. 
 *   EXTR_PREFIX_SAME
 *       If there is a collision, prefix the variable name with prefix. 
 *   EXTR_PREFIX_ALL
 *       Prefix all variable names with prefix. 
 *   EXTR_PREFIX_INVALID
 *       Only prefix invalid/numeric variable names with prefix. 
 *   EXTR_IF_EXISTS
 *       Only overwrite the variable if it already exists in the current symbol table
 *       otherwise do nothing.
 *       This is useful for defining a list of valid variables and then extracting only those
 *       variables you have defined out of $_REQUEST, for example. 
 *   EXTR_PREFIX_IF_EXISTS
 *       Only create prefixed variable names if the non-prefixed version of the same variable exists in 
 *      the current symbol table.
 * $prefix
 *  Note that prefix is only required if extract_type is EXTR_PREFIX_SAME, EXTR_PREFIX_ALL
 *  EXTR_PREFIX_INVALID or EXTR_PREFIX_IF_EXISTS. If the prefixed result is not a valid variable name
 *  it is not imported into the symbol table. Prefixes are automatically separated from the array key by an
 *  underscore character.
 * Return
 *   Returns the number of variables successfully imported into the symbol table.

 *      The third parameter, attribs, contains an associative array with the element's attributes (if any).

 *     end_element_handler(resource $parser,string $name)
 *    $parser
 *      The first parameter, parser, is a reference to the XML parser calling the handler.

** Translate a single UTF-8 character.  Return the unicode value.
**
** During translation, assume that the byte that zTerm points
** is a 0x00.
**
** Write a pointer to the next unread byte back into *pzNext.
**
** Notes On Invalid UTF-8:
**
**  *  This routine never allows a 7-bit character (0x00 through 0x7f) to
**     be encoded as a multi-byte character.  Any multi-byte character that
**     attempts to encode a value between 0x00 and 0x7f is rendered as 0xfffd.
**
**  *  This routine never allows a UTF16 surrogate value to be encoded.
**     If a multi-byte character attempts to encode a value between
**     0xd800 and 0xe000 then it is rendered as 0xfffd.
**
**  *  Bytes in the range of 0x80 through 0xbf which occur as the first
**     byte of a character are interpreted as single-byte characters
**     and rendered as themselves even though they are technically
**     invalid characters.
**
**  *  This routine accepts an infinite number of different UTF8 encodings
**     for unicode values 0x80 and greater.  It do not change over-length
**     encodings to 0xfffd as some systems recommend.

 * Open an IO stream handle.
 * Notes on stream:
 * According to the PHP reference manual.
 * In its simplest definition, a stream is a resource object which exhibits streamable behavior.
 * That is, it can be read from or written to in a linear fashion, and may be able to fseek() 
 * to an arbitrary locations within the stream.
 * A wrapper is additional code which tells the stream how to handle specific protocols/encodings.
 * For example, the http wrapper knows how to translate a URL into an HTTP/1.0 request for a file
 * on a remote server.
 * A stream is referenced as: scheme://target
 *   scheme(string) - The name of the wrapper to be used. Examples include: file, http...
 *   If no wrapper is specified, the function default is used (typically file://).
 *   target - Depends on the wrapper used. For filesystem related streams this is typically a path
 *  and filename of the desired file. For network related streams this is typically a hostname, often
 *  with a path appended. 
 *
 * Note that PH7 IO streams looks like PHP streams but their implementation differ greately.
 * Please refer to the official documentation for a full discussion.
 * This function return a handle on success. Otherwise null.

 *   'x' 	Create and open for writing only; place the file pointer at the beginning of the file. If the file

 *         the fopen() call will fail by returning FALSE and generating an error of level E_WARNING. If the file

 *          as using 'w' could truncate the file before the lock was obtained (if truncation is desired, ftruncate() can
 *          be used after the lock is requested).

 * php:// Accessing various I/O streams

 *  Allow direct access to the corresponding input or output stream of the PHP process.
 *  The stream references a duplicate file descriptor, so if you open php://stdin and later
 *  close it, you close only your copy of the descriptor-the actual stream referenced by STDIN is unaffected.
 *  php://stdin is read-only, whereas php://stdout and php://stderr are write-only.
 * php://output
 *  php://output is a write-only stream that allows you to write to the output buffer

/*
 * This file implement a hand-coded, thread-safe, full-reentrant and highly-efficient
 * expression parser for the PH7 engine.
 * Besides from the one introudced by PHP (Over 60), the PH7 engine have introduced three new
 * operators. These are 'eq', 'ne' and the comma operator ','.
 * The eq and ne operators are borrowed from the Perl world. They are used for strict
 * string comparison. The reason why they have been implemented in the PH7 engine
 * and introduced as an extension to the PHP programming language is due to the confusion
 * introduced by the standard PHP comparison operators ('==' or '===') especially if you
 * are comparing strings with numbers.
 * Take the following example: 
 * var_dump( 0xFF == '255' ); // bool(true) ???
 * // use the type equal operator by adding a single space to one of the operand
 * var_dump( '255  ' === '255' ); //bool(true) depending on the PHP version
 * That is, if one of the operand looks like a number (either integer or float) then PHP
 * will internally convert the two operands to numbers and then a numeric comparison is performed.
 * This is what the PHP language reference manual says:
 * If you compare a number with a string or the comparison involves numerical strings, then each
 * string is converted to a number and the comparison performed numerically. 
 * Bummer, if you ask me,this is broken, badly broken. I mean,the programmer cannot dictate
 * it's comparison rule, it's the underlying engine who decides in it's place and perform
 * the internal conversion. In most cases,PHP developers wants simple string comparison and they
 * are stuck to use the ugly and inefficient strcmp() function and it's variants instead.
 * This is the big reason why we have introduced these two operators.
 * The eq operator is used to compare two strings byte per byte. If you came from the C/C++ world
 * think of this operator as a barebone implementation of the memcmp() C standard library function.
 * Keep in mind that if you are comparing two ASCII strings then the capital letters and their lowercase
 * letters are completely different and so this example will output false.
 * var_dump('allo' eq 'Allo'); //bool(FALSE)
 * The ne operator perform the opposite operation of the eq operator and is used to test for string
 * inequality. This example will output true
 * var_dump('allo' ne 'Allo'); //bool(TRUE) unequal strings
 * The eq operator return a Boolean true if and only if the two strings are identical while the
 * ne operator return a Boolean true if and only if the two strings are different. Otherwise
 * a Boolean false is returned (equal strings).
 * Note that the comparison is performed only if the two strings are of the same length.
 * Otherwise the eq and ne operators return a Boolean false without performing any comparison
 * and avoid us wasting CPU time for nothing.
 * Again remember that we talk about a low level byte per byte comparison and nothing else.
 * Also remember that zero length strings are always equal.
 *
 * Again, another powerful mechanism borrowed from the C/C++ world and introduced as an extension
 * to the PHP programming language.
 * A comma expression contains two operands of any type separated by a comma and has left-to-right
 * associativity. The left operand is fully evaluated, possibly producing side effects, and its
 * value, if there is one, is discarded. The right operand is then evaluated. The type and value
 * of the result of a comma expression are those of its right operand, after the usual unary conversions. 
 * Any number of expressions separated by commas can form a single expression because the comma operator
 * is associative. The use of the comma operator guarantees that the sub-expressions will be evaluated
 * in left-to-right order, and the value of the last becomes the value of the entire expression.
 * The following example assign the value 25 to the variable $a, multiply the value of $a with 2
 * and assign the result to variable $b and finally we call a test function to output the value
 * of $a and $b. Keep-in mind that all theses operations are done in a single expression using

 * Exprressions: According to the PHP language reference manual
 *
 * Expressions are the most important building stones of PHP. In PHP, almost anything you write is an expression.
 * The simplest yet most accurate way to define an expression is "anything that has a value".
 * The most basic forms of expressions are constants and variables. When you type "$a = 5", you're assigning
 * '5' into $a. '5', obviously, has the value 5, or in other words '5' is an expression with the value of 5
 * (in this case, '5' is an integer constant).
 * After this assignment, you'd expect $a's value to be 5 as well, so if you wrote $b = $a, you'd expect
 * it to behave just as if you wrote $b = 5. In other words, $a is an expression with the value of 5 as well.
 * If everything works right, this is exactly what will happen.
 * Slightly more complex examples for expressions are functions. For instance, consider the following function:
 * <?php
 * function foo ()
 * {
 *   return 5;
 * }
 * ?>
 * Assuming you're familiar with the concept of functions (if you're not, take a look at the chapter about functions)
 * you'd assume that typing $c = foo() is essentially just like writing $c = 5, and you're right.
 * Functions are expressions with the value of their return value. Since foo() returns 5, the value of the expression
 * 'foo()' is 5. Usually functions don't just return a static value but compute something.
 * Of course, values in PHP don't have to be integers, and very often they aren't.
 * PHP supports four scalar value types: integer values, floating point values (float), string values and boolean values
 * (scalar values are values that you can't 'break' into smaller pieces, unlike arrays, for instance).
 * PHP also supports two composite (non-scalar) types: arrays and objects. Each of these value types can be assigned
 * into variables or returned from functions.
 * PHP takes expressions much further, in the same way many other languages do. PHP is an expression-oriented language
 * in the sense that almost everything is an expression. Consider the example we've already dealt with, '$a = 5'.
 * It's easy to see that there are two values involved here, the value of the integer constant '5', and the value 
 * of $a which is being updated to 5 as well. But the truth is that there's one additional value involved here
 * and that's the value of the assignment itself. The assignment itself evaluates to the assigned value, in this case 5.
 * In practice, it means that '$a = 5', regardless of what it does, is an expression with the value 5. Thus, writing 
 * something like '$b = ($a = 5)' is like writing '$a = 5; $b = 5;' (a semicolon marks the end of a statement).
 * Since assignments are parsed in a right to left order, you can also write '$b = $a = 5'.
 * Another good example of expression orientation is pre- and post-increment and decrement.
 * Users of PHP and many other languages may be familiar with the notation of variable++ and variable--.
 * These are increment and decrement operators. In PHP, like in C, there are two types of increment - pre-increment
 * and post-increment. Both pre-increment and post-increment essentially increment the variable, and the effect
 * on the variable is identical. The difference is with the value of the increment expression. Pre-increment, which is written
 * '++$variable', evaluates to the incremented value (PHP increments the variable before reading its value, thus the name 'pre-increment').
 * Post-increment, which is written '$variable++' evaluates to the original value of $variable, before it was incremented 
 * (PHP increments the variable after reading its value, thus the name 'post-increment').
 * A very common type of expressions are comparison expressions. These expressions evaluate to either FALSE or TRUE.
 * PHP supports > (bigger than), >= (bigger than or equal to), == (equal), != (not equal), < (smaller than) and <= (smaller than or equal to).
 * The language also supports a set of strict equivalence operators: === (equal to and same type) and !== (not equal to or not same type).
 * These expressions are most commonly used inside conditional execution, such as if statements.
 * The last example of expressions we'll deal with here is combined operator-assignment expressions.
 * You already know that if you want to increment $a by 1, you can simply write '$a++' or '++$a'.
 * But what if you want to add more than one to it, for instance 3? You could write '$a++' multiple times, but this is obviously not a very
 * efficient or comfortable way. A much more common practice is to write '$a = $a + 3'. '$a + 3' evaluates to the value of $a plus 3
 * and is assigned back into $a, which results in incrementing $a by 3. In PHP, as in several other languages like C, you can write
 * this in a shorter way, which with time would become clearer and quicker to understand as well. Adding 3 to the current value of $a
 * can be written '$a += 3'. This means exactly "take the value of $a, add 3 to it, and assign it back into $a".
 * In addition to being shorter and clearer, this also results in faster execution. The value of '$a += 3', like the value of a regular
 * assignment, is the assigned value. Notice that it is NOT 3, but the combined value of $a plus 3 (this is the value that's assigned into $a).
 * Any two-place operator can be used in this operator-assignment mode, for example '$a -= 5' (subtract 5 from the value of $a), '$b *= 7'
 * (multiply the value of $b by 7), etc.
 * There is one more expression that may seem odd if you haven't seen it in other languages, the ternary conditional operator:
 * <?php
 * $first ? $second : $third
 * ?>
 * If the value of the first subexpression is TRUE (non-zero), then the second subexpression is evaluated, and that is the result
 * of the conditional expression. Otherwise, the third subexpression is evaluated, and that is the value.

 *  Anonymous functions, also known as closures, allow the creation of functions
 *  which have no specified name. They are most useful as the value of callback
 *  parameters, but they have many other uses. 
 *  Closures may also inherit variables from the parent scope. Any such variables
 *  must be declared in the function header. Inheriting variables from the parent
 *  scope is not the same as using global variables. Global variables exist in the global scope
 *  which is the same no matter what function is executing. The parent scope of a closure is the 
 *  function in which the closure was declared (not necessarily the function it was called from).
 *
 * Some example:
 *  $greet = function($name)
 * {
 *   printf("Hello %s\r\n", $name);
 * };
 *  $greet('World');
 *  $greet('PHP');
 *
 * $double = function($a) {
 *   return $a * 2;
 * };
 * // This is our range of numbers
 * $numbers = range(1, 5);
 * // Use the Annonymous function as a callback here to 
 * // double the size of each element in our 
 * // range
 * $new_numbers = array_map($double, $numbers);

 * Create a class instance [i.e: Object in the PHP jargon] at run-time.
 * The following function is called when an object is created at run-time
 * typically when the PH7_OP_NEW/PH7_OP_CLONE instructions are executed.
 * Notes on object creation.
 *
 * According to PHP language reference manual.
 * To create an instance of a class, the new keyword must be used. An object will always
 * be created unless the object has a constructor defined that throws an exception on error.
 * Classes should be defined before instantiation (and in some cases this is a requirement).
 * If a string containing the name of a class is used with new, a new instance of that class
 * will be created. If the class is in a namespace, its fully qualified name must be used when
 * doing this.
 * Example #3 Creating an instance
 * <?php
 *  $instance = new SimpleClass();
 *   // This can also be done with a variable:
 * $className = 'Foo';
 * $instance = new $className(); // Foo()
 * ?>
 * In the class context, it is possible to create a new object by new self and new parent.
 * When assigning an already created instance of a class to a new variable, the new variable
 * will access the same instance as the object that was assigned. This behaviour is the same
 * when passing instances to a function. A copy of an already created object can be made by 
 * cloning it.
 * Example #4 Object Assignment
 * <?php
 *  class SimpleClass(){
 *    public $var;
 *  };
 *  $instance = new SimpleClass();
 *  $assigned   =  $instance;
 *  $reference  =& $instance;
 *  $instance->var = '$assigned will have this value';
 *  $instance = null; // $instance and $reference become null
 *  var_dump($instance);
 *  var_dump($reference);
 *  var_dump($assigned);
 * ?>
 * The above example will output:
 * NULL
 * NULL
 * object(SimpleClass)#1 (1) {
 *  ["var"]=>
 *    string(30) "$assigned will have this value"
 * }
 * Example #5 Creating new objects
 * <?php
 * class Test 
 * {
 *   static public function getNew()
 *   {
 *       return new static;
 *   }
 * }
 * class Child extends Test
 * {}
 * $obj1 = new Test();
 * $obj2 = new $obj1;
 * var_dump($obj1 !== $obj2);
 * $obj3 = Test::getNew();
 * var_dump($obj3 instanceof Test);
 * $obj4 = Child::getNew();
 * var_dump($obj4 instanceof Child);
 * ?>
 * The above example will output:
 * bool(true)
 * bool(true)
 * bool(true)
 * Note that Symisc Systems have introduced powerfull extension to
 * OO subsystem. For example a class attribute may have any complex
 * expression associated with it when declaring the attribute unlike
 * the standard PHP engine which would allow a single value.
 * Example:
 *  class myClass{
 *    public $var = 25<<1+foo()/bar();
 *  };
 * Refer to the official documentation for more information.

 *
 * According to PHP language reference manual.
 * Creating a copy of an object with fully replicated properties is not always the wanted behavior.
 * A good example of the need for copy constructors. Another example is if your object holds a reference
 * to another object which it uses and when you replicate the parent object you want to create 
 * a new instance of this other object so that the replica has its own separate copy.
 * An object copy is created by using the clone keyword (which calls the object's __clone() method if possible).
 * An object's __clone() method cannot be called directly.
 * $copy_of_object = clone $object;
 * When an object is cloned, PHP 5 will perform a shallow copy of all of the object's properties.
 * Any properties that are references to other variables, will remain references.
 * Once the cloning is complete, if a __clone() method is defined, then the newly created object's __clone() method 
 * will be called, to allow any necessary properties that need to be changed.
 * Example #1 Cloning an object
 * <?php
 * class SubObject
 * {
 *   static $instances = 0;
 *   public $instance;
 *
 *   public function __construct() {
 *       $this->instance = ++self::$instances;

 *   }
 * }
 * 
 * class MyCloneable
 * {

 *   public $object2;
 *
 *   function __clone()
 *   {
 *       // Force a copy of this->object, otherwise
 *       // it will point to same object.
 *       $this->object1 = clone $this->object1;
 *   }
 * }
 * $obj = new MyCloneable();
 * $obj->object1 = new SubObject();
 * $obj->object2 = new SubObject();
 * $obj2 = clone $obj;
 * print("Original Object:\n");
 * print_r($obj);
 * print("Cloned Object:\n");
 * print_r($obj2);

 * echo "\nTwo references to the same instance\n";
 * compareObjects($o, $q);

 * According to the PHP language reference manual.
 *  The function names __construct(), __destruct(), __call(), __callStatic()

 * You cannot have functions with these names in any of your classes unless
 * you want the magic functionality associated with them.
 * Example of magical methods:
 * __toString()
 *  The __toString() method allows a class to decide how it will react when it is treated like
 *  a string. For example, what echo $obj; will print. This method must return a string.
 *  Example #2 Simple example
 * <?php
 * // Declare a simple class
 * class TestClass
 * {
 *   public $foo;
 *
 *   public function __construct($foo)
 *   {
 *       $this->foo = $foo;
 *   }
 *
 *   public function __toString()
 *   {
 *       return $this->foo;
 *   }
 * }
 * $class = new TestClass('Hello');
 * echo $class;
 * ?>
 * The above example will output:
 *  Hello
 *
 * Note that PH7 does not support all the magical method and introudces __toFloat(),__toInt()
 * which have the same behaviour as __toString() but for float and integer types
 * respectively.
 * Refer to the official documentation for more information.

/*
 * Extract a heredoc/nowdoc text from a raw PHP input.
 * According to the PHP language reference manual:
 *  A third way to delimit strings is the heredoc syntax: <<<. After this operator, an identifier
 *  is provided, then a newline. The string itself follows, and then the same identifier again
 *  to close the quotation.
 *  The closing identifier must begin in the first column of the line. Also, the identifier must 
 *  follow the same naming rules as any other label in PHP: it must contain only alphanumeric 
 *  characters and underscores, and must start with a non-digit character or underscore. 
 *  Heredoc text behaves just like a double-quoted string, without the double quotes.
 *  This means that quotes in a heredoc do not need to be escaped, but the escape codes listed
 *  above can still be used. Variables are expanded, but the same care must be taken when expressing
 *  complex variables inside a heredoc as with strings. 
 *  Nowdocs are to single-quoted strings what heredocs are to double-quoted strings.
 *  A nowdoc is specified similarly to a heredoc, but no parsing is done inside a nowdoc.
 *  The construct is ideal for embedding PHP code or other large blocks of text without the need
 *  for escaping. It shares some features in common with the SGML <![CDATA[ ]]> construct, in that
 *  it declares a block of text which is not for parsing.
 *  A nowdoc is identified with the same <<< sequence used for heredocs, but the identifier which follows
 *  is enclosed in single quotes, e.g. <<<'EOT'. All the rules for heredoc identifiers also apply to nowdoc
 *  identifiers, especially those regarding the appearance of the closing identifier. 
 * Symisc Extension:
 * The closing delimiter can now start with a digit or undersocre or it can be an UTF-8 stream.
 * Example:
 *  <<<123
 *    HEREDOC Here
 * 123
 *  or
 *  <<<___
 *   HEREDOC Here
 *  ___

 * High level public tokenizer.
 *  Tokenize the input into PHP tokens and raw tokens [i.e: HTML,XML,Raw text...].
 * According to the PHP language reference manual
 *   When PHP parses a file, it looks for opening and closing tags, which tell PHP
 *   to start and stop interpreting the code between them. Parsing in this manner allows
 *   PHP to be embedded in all sorts of different documents, as everything outside of a pair
 *   of opening and closing tags is ignored by the PHP parser. Most of the time you will see
 *   PHP embedded in HTML documents, as in this example. 
 *   <?php echo 'While this is going to be parsed.'; ?>
 *   <p>This will also be ignored.</p>
 *   You can also use more advanced structures:
 *   Example #1 Advanced escaping
 * <?php
 * if ($expression) {
 *   ?>
 *   <strong>This is true.</strong>
 *   <?php
 * } else {
 *   ?>
 *   <strong>This is false.</strong>
 *   <?php
 * }
 * ?>
 * This works as expected, because when PHP hits the ?> closing tags, it simply starts outputting
 * whatever it finds (except for an immediately following newline - see instruction separation ) until it hits
 * another opening tag. The example given here is contrived, of course, but for outputting large blocks of text
 * dropping out of PHP parsing mode is generally more efficient than sending all of the text through echo() or print().
 * There are four different pairs of opening and closing tags which can be used in PHP. Three of those, <?php ?> 
 * <script language="php"> </script>  and <? ?> are always available. The other two are short tags and ASP style
 * tags, and can be turned on and off from the php.ini configuration file. As such, while some people find short tags
 * and ASP style tags convenient, they are less portable, and generally not recommended.
 * Note:
 * Also note that if you are embedding PHP within XML or XHTML you will need to use the <?php ?> tags to remain
 * compliant with standards.
 * Example #2 PHP Opening and Closing Tags
 * 1.  <?php echo 'if you want to serve XHTML or XML documents, do it like this'; ?>
 * 2.  <script language="php">

 * Process variable expression [i.e: "$var","${var}"] embedded in a double quoted/heredoc string.
 * According to the PHP language reference manual
 *   When a string is specified in double quotes or with heredoc,variables are parsed within it.
 *  There are two types of syntax: a simple one and a complex one. The simple syntax is the most
 *  common and convenient. It provides a way to embed a variable, an array value, or an object
 *  property in a string with a minimum of effort.
 *  Simple syntax
 *   If a dollar sign ($) is encountered, the parser will greedily take as many tokens as possible
 *   to form a valid variable name. Enclose the variable name in curly braces to explicitly specify
 *   the end of the name.
 *   Similarly, an array index or an object property can be parsed. With array indices, the closing
 *   square bracket (]) marks the end of the index. The same rules apply to object properties
 *   as to simple variables. 
 *  Complex (curly) syntax
 *   This isn't called complex because the syntax is complex, but because it allows for the use 
 *   of complex expressions.
 *   Any scalar variable, array element or object property with a string representation can be
 *   included via this syntax. Simply write the expression the same way as it would appear outside
 *   the string, and then wrap it in { and }. Since { can not be escaped, this syntax will only
 *   be recognised when the $ immediately follows the {. Use {\$ to get a literal {$

 * Heredoc
 *  A third way to delimit strings is the heredoc syntax: <<<. After this operator, an identifier
 *  is provided, then a newline. The string itself follows, and then the same identifier again
 *  to close the quotation.
 *  The closing identifier must begin in the first column of the line. Also, the identifier must
 *  follow the same naming rules as any other label in PHP: it must contain only alphanumeric
 *  characters and underscores, and must start with a non-digit character or underscore.
 *  Warning
 *  It is very important to note that the line with the closing identifier must contain
 *  no other characters, except possibly a semicolon (;). That means especially that the identifier
 *  may not be indented, and there may not be any spaces or tabs before or after the semicolon.
 *  It's also important to realize that the first character before the closing identifier must
 *  be a newline as defined by the local operating system. This is \n on UNIX systems, including Mac OS X.
 *  The closing delimiter (possibly followed by a semicolon) must also be followed by a newline.
 *  If this rule is broken and the closing identifier is not "clean", it will not be considered a closing
 *  identifier, and PHP will continue looking for one. If a proper closing identifier is not found before
 *  the end of the current file, a parse error will result at the last line.
 *  Heredocs can not be used for initializing class properties. 
 * Double quoted
 *  If the string is enclosed in double-quotes ("), PHP will interpret more escape sequences for special characters:
 *  Escaped characters Sequence 	Meaning
 *  \n linefeed (LF or 0x0A (10) in ASCII)
 *  \r carriage return (CR or 0x0D (13) in ASCII)
 *  \t horizontal tab (HT or 0x09 (9) in ASCII)
 *  \v vertical tab (VT or 0x0B (11) in ASCII)
 *  \f form feed (FF or 0x0C (12) in ASCII)
 *  \\ backslash
 *  \$ dollar sign
 *  \" double-quote
 *  \[0-7]{1,3} 	the sequence of characters matching the regular expression is a character in octal notation
 *  \x[0-9A-Fa-f]{1,2} 	the sequence of characters matching the regular expression is a character in hexadecimal notation
 * As in single quoted strings, escaping any other character will result in the backslash being printed too.
 * The most important feature of double-quoted strings is the fact that variable names will be expanded.
 * See string parsing for details.

 *  variables will have no effect on the other. For more information on this kind of assignment, see
 *  the chapter on Expressions.
 *  PHP also offers another way to assign values to variables: assign by reference. This means that
 *  the new variable simply references (in other words, "becomes an alias for" or "points to") the original
 *  variable. Changes to the new variable affect the original, and vice versa.
 *  To assign by reference, simply prepend an ampersand (&) to the beginning of the variable which

 *  A constant is an identifier (name) for a simple value. As the name suggests, that value

 *  A constant is case-sensitive by default. By convention, constant identifiers are always uppercase.
 *  The name of a constant follows the same rules as any label in PHP. A valid constant name starts
 *  with a letter or underscore, followed by any number of letters, numbers, or underscores.
 *  As a regular expression it would be expressed thusly: [a-zA-Z_\x7f-\xff][a-zA-Z0-9_\x7f-\xff]* 
 *  Syntax
 *  You can define a constant by using the define()-function or by using the const keyword outside
 *  a class definition. Once a constant is defined, it can never be changed or undefined.
 *  You can get the value of a constant by simply specifying its name. Unlike with variables
 *  you should not prepend a constant with a $. You can also use the function constant() to read
 *  a constant's value if you wish to obtain the constant's name dynamically. Use get_defined_constants()
 *  to get a list of all defined constants.
 * 
 * Symisc eXtension.
 *  PH7 allow any complex expression to be associated with the constant while the zend engine
 *  would allow only simple scalar value.
 *  Example
 *    const HELLO = "Welcome "." guest ".rand_str(3); //Valid under PH7/Generate error using the zend engine
 *    Refer to the official documentation for more information on this feature.

 *  The meaning of a while statement is simple. It tells PHP to execute the nested statement(s)
 *  repeatedly, as long as the while expression evaluates to TRUE. The value of the expression
 *  is checked each time at the beginning of the loop, so even if this value changes during
 *  the execution of the nested statement(s), execution will not stop until the end of the iteration
 *  (each time PHP runs the statements in the loop is one iteration). Sometimes, if the while
 *  expression evaluates to FALSE from the very beginning, the nested statement(s) won't even be run once.
 *  Like with the if statement, you can group multiple statements within the same while loop by surrounding
 *  a group of statements with curly braces, or by using the alternate syntax:
 *  while (expr):
 *    statement

 *    statement
 *  foreach (array_expression as $key => $value)
 *   statement
 *  The first form loops over the array given by array_expression. On each loop, the value 
 *  of the current element is assigned to $value and the internal array pointer is advanced
 *  by one (so on the next loop, you'll be looking at the next element).
 *  The second form does the same thing, except that the current element's key will be assigned
 *  to the variable $key on each loop.
 *  Note:
 *  When foreach first starts executing, the internal array pointer is automatically reset to the
 *  first element of the array. This means that you do not need to call reset() before a foreach loop.
 *  Note:
 *  Unless the array is referenced, foreach operates on a copy of the specified array and not the array
 *  itself. foreach has some side effects on the array pointer. Don't rely on the array pointer during
 *  or after the foreach without resetting it.
 *  You can easily modify array's elements by preceding $value with &. This will assign reference instead

/*
 * Compile the infamous if/elseif/else if/else statements.
 * According to the PHP language reference
 *  The if construct is one of the most important features of many languages PHP included.
 *  It allows for conditional execution of code fragments. PHP features an if structure 
 *  that is similar to that of C:
 *  if (expr)
 *   statement
 *  else construct:
 *   Often you'd want to execute a statement if a certain condition is met, and a different
 *   statement if the condition is not met. This is what else is for. else extends an if statement
 *   to execute a statement in case the expression in the if statement evaluates to FALSE.
 *   For example, the following code would display a is greater than b if $a is greater than
 *   $b, and a is NOT greater than b otherwise.
 *   The else statement is only executed if the if expression evaluated to FALSE, and if there
 *   were any elseif expressions - only if they evaluated to FALSE as well
 *  elseif
 *   elseif, as its name suggests, is a combination of if and else. Like else, it extends
 *   an if statement to execute a different statement in case the original if expression evaluates
 *   to FALSE. However, unlike else, it will execute that alternative expression only if the elseif
 *   conditional expression evaluates to TRUE. For example, the following code would display a is bigger
 *   than b, a equal to b or a is smaller than b:
 *   <?php
 *    if ($a > $b) {
 *     echo "a is bigger than b";
 *    } elseif ($a == $b) {
 *     echo "a is equal to b";
 *    } else {
 *     echo "a is smaller than b";
 *    }
 *    ?>

 * Compile a namespace statement

 *  This can be seen as an abstract concept in many places. For example, in any operating system
 *  directories serve to group related files, and act as a namespace for the files within them.
 *  As a concrete example, the file foo.txt can exist in both directory /home/greg and in /home/other
 *  but two copies of foo.txt cannot co-exist in the same directory. In addition, to access the foo.txt
 *  file outside of the /home/greg directory, we must prepend the directory name to the file name using
 *  the directory separator to get /home/greg/foo.txt. This same principle extends to namespaces in the
 *  programming world.
 *  In the PHP world, namespaces are designed to solve two problems that authors of libraries and applications
 *  encounter when creating re-usable code elements such as classes or functions:

 * <?php
 * function takes_array($input)
 * {
 *    echo "$input[0] + $input[1] = ", $input[0]+$input[1];

 * Making arguments be passed by reference
 * By default, function arguments are passed by value (so that if the value of the argument
 * within the function is changed, it does not get changed outside of the function).
 * To allow a function to modify its arguments, they must be passed by reference.
 * To have an argument to a function always passed by reference, prepend an ampersand (&)
 * to the argument name in the function definition:
 * Example #2 Passing function parameters by reference
 * <?php

 *   protected or public, but not private. Furthermore the signatures of the methods must

 *   This also applies to constructors as of PHP 5.4. Before 5.4 constructor signatures

 *    When an exception is thrown, code following the statement will not be executed, and PHP
 *    will attempt to find the first matching catch block. If an exception is not caught, a PHP
 *    Fatal Error will be issued with an "Uncaught Exception ..." message, unless a handler has
 *    been defined with set_exception_handler().

 *  This is exactly what the switch statement is for.
 *  Note: Note that unlike some other languages, the continue statement applies to switch and acts
 *  similar to break. If you have a switch inside a loop and wish to continue to the next iteration
 *  of the outer loop, use continue 2. 
 *  Note that switch/case does loose comparision. 
 *  It is important to understand how the switch statement is executed in order to avoid mistakes.
 *  The switch statement executes line by line (actually, statement by statement).
 *  In the beginning, no code is executed. Only when a case statement is found with a value that
 *  matches the value of the switch expression does PHP begin to execute the statements.
 *  PHP continues to execute the statements until the end of the switch block, or the first time
 *  it sees a break statement. If you don't write a break statement at the end of a case's statement list.
 *  In a switch statement, the condition is evaluated only once and the result is compared to each
 *  case statement. In an elseif statement, the condition is evaluated again. If your condition
 *  is more complicated than a simple compare and/or is in a tight loop, a switch may be faster.
 *  The statement list for a case can also be empty, which simply passes control into the statement
 *  list for the next case. 
 *  The case expression may be any expression that evaluates to a simple type, that is, integer
 *  or floating-point numbers and strings.

/*
 * Format a given string and invoke the given callback on each processed chunk.
 *  According to the PHP reference manual.
 * The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters
 * (excluding %) that are copied directly to the result, and conversion 
 * specifications, each of which results in fetching its own parameter.
 * This applies to both sprintf() and printf().
 * Each conversion specification consists of a percent sign (%), followed by one
 * or more of these elements, in order:
 *   An optional sign specifier that forces a sign (- or +) to be used on a number.
 *   By default, only the - sign is used on a number if it's negative. This specifier forces
 *   positive numbers to have the + sign attached as well.
 *   An optional padding specifier that says what character will be used for padding
 *   the results to the right string size. This may be a space character or a 0 (zero character).
 *   The default is to pad with spaces. An alternate padding character can be specified by prefixing
 *   it with a single quote ('). See the examples below.
 *   An optional alignment specifier that says if the result should be left-justified or right-justified.
 *   The default is right-justified; a - character here will make it left-justified.
 *   An optional number, a width specifier that says how many characters (minimum) this conversion
 *   should result in.
 *   An optional precision specifier in the form of a period (`.') followed by an optional decimal
 *   digit string that says how many decimal digits should be displayed for floating-point numbers.
 *   When using this specifier on a string, it acts as a cutoff point, setting a maximum character
 *   limit to the string.
 *  A type specifier that says what type the argument data should be treated as. Possible types:
 *       % - a literal percent character. No argument is required.
 *       b - the argument is treated as an integer, and presented as a binary number.
 *       c - the argument is treated as an integer, and presented as the character with that ASCII value.
 *       d - the argument is treated as an integer, and presented as a (signed) decimal number.
 *       e - the argument is treated as scientific notation (e.g. 1.2e+2). The precision specifier stands 
 * 	     for the number of digits after the decimal point.
 *       E - like %e but uses uppercase letter (e.g. 1.2E+2).
 *       u - the argument is treated as an integer, and presented as an unsigned decimal number.
 *       f - the argument is treated as a float, and presented as a floating-point number (locale aware).
 *       F - the argument is treated as a float, and presented as a floating-point number (non-locale aware).
 *       g - shorter of %e and %f.
 *       G - shorter of %E and %f.
 *       o - the argument is treated as an integer, and presented as an octal number.
 *       s - the argument is treated as and presented as a string.
 *       x - the argument is treated as an integer and presented as a hexadecimal number (with lowercase letters).
 *       X - the argument is treated as an integer and presented as a hexadecimal number (with uppercase letters).

*    Properties
*     The basic element contained in an INI file is the property. Every property has a name and a value

*     Example:
*      name=value
*    Sections
*     Properties may be grouped into arbitrarily named sections. The section name appears on a line by itself
*     in square brackets ([ and ]). All properties after the section declaration are associated with that section.
*     There is no explicit "end of section" delimiter; sections end at the next section declaration
*     or the end of the file. Sections may not be nested.
*     Example:
*      [section]
*   Comments

 * $month
 *  The number of the month relevant to the end of the previous year. Values 1 to 12 reference
 *  the normal calendar months of the year in question. Values less than 1 (including negative values)
 *  reference the months in the previous year in reverse order, so 0 is December, -1 is November)...
 * $day
 *  The number of the day relevant to the end of the previous month. Values 1 to 28, 29, 30 or 31 
 *  (depending upon the month) reference the normal days in the relevant month. Values less than 1
 *  (including negative values) reference the days in the previous month, so 0 is the last day 
 *  of the previous month, -1 is the day before that, etc. Values greater than the number of days
 *  in the relevant month reference the appropriate day in the following month(s).
 * $year
 *  The number of the year, may be a two or four digit value, with values between 0-69 mapping
 *  to 2000-2069 and 70-100 to 1970-2000. On systems where time_t is a 32bit signed integer, as 
 *  most common today, the valid range for year is somewhere between 1901 and 2038.
 * $is_dst
 *  This parameter can be set to 1 if the time is during daylight savings time (DST), 0 if it is not,
 *  or -1 (the default) if it is unknown whether the time is within daylight savings time or not. 
 * Return
 *   mktime() returns the Unix timestamp of the arguments given. 
 *   If the arguments are invalid, the function returns FALSE
